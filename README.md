The program is executed in the logic of time management, inspired by the course of
Saint-Petersburg State Marine Technical University "Organization of production processes". 
This program allows you to distribute and organize multiple projects on the time axis.
Also you can divide the project into stages and monitor the implementation of each part of the project.
